# Purchase Analytics

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or later, due to extensive use of type-hints.

## Testing

### Integration tests

We copied and extended the test suite from the original Purchase Analytics [starter code](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/Purchase-Analytics). To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
cd insight_testsuite
./run_tests.sh
```

### Unit tests

We also wrote several unit tests in the `./test_purchase_analytics.py` file. Those tests can be executed using the following command:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
